BoxClient is a library to remotely access Box.net accounts using the REST api.
This was originally written to supply the needs of the BoxFS project and
latelly it became a separate library for public use.

== Use
require 'box_client'
# These first 3 steps are mandatory for authentication
client = BoxClient::Client.new("your_api_key_goes_here")
client.authentication_url # you get the authentication URL here
# The user must visit this URL to authenticate using his username and password
client.get_auth_token # validate the authentication
# Now we're free to use the API
client.get_tree # get the root tree
client.get_tree(:id => 23456) # get the tree to folder with 23456 id
client.get_tree(:onelevel => false) # get the tree to root recursively
